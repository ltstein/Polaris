## Realsense Integration

I have created a modified version of the 3.1 Optics Bracket. The mounting location of the commercial Leap Motion sensor has been shifted down and forward to allow for a flat top for the headset and better clearance to attach the Leap Motion cable. This modification also includes additional heat set screw attachment points which for improved mounting of devices. 

Along with this I created a mounting bracket for the Intel Realsense D435 Depth Camera and T265 Tracking Cameras.

Both of these items are still being tested so utilize with caution. 

STLs for both designs are maintained [here](https://github.com/ltstein/Polaris/tree/dev/Mechanical/North%20Star%20Release%203%203D%20Files/Experimental).
