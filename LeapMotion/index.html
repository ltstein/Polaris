<h3>Introduction</h3>

The purpose of this guide is to instruct, with access to a few common tools, how to make a Project North Star reference AR headset. It's aimed to be accessible and inexpensive to build, using as many off-the-shelf components and 3D-printed parts as possible. For now, several key components are custom-made (e.g. the reflectors, display driver board, and our custom ultra-wide hand tracking module), but we know that together we can find make some work arounds and alternatives.<br/><br/> 

Although not a complete AR solution, Project North Star points to a future where the physical and virtual worlds blend together into a single magical experience. With it we hope to gather like-minded people and build that future together.<br/><br/>
