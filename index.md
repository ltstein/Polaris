## Welcome to Polaris

Polaris is based on Project North Star by Leap Motion. It is my project to create and expand this into my own augmented reality experience.  

Project North Star is under active develpment by the community and Leap Motion. 

### Navigation

- **RealSense Integration**- Interested in using the D435 and T265 for tracking and depth mapping. Learn more [here](RealSenseIntegration.md)

**UPDATE**
- **SteamVR Driver**- Awesome folks in the community have built a SteamVR driver for Project North Star. I've set up a small release which I hope will smooth the transition while a more full featured set up can be implemented. Check it out [here](https://github.com/ltstein/project_northstar_openvr_driver/releases/tag/v0.1.0)
